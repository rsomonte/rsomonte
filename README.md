# Hi, welcome to my GitHub

I study cybersecurity and computer science, and I love technology.
I enjoy learning new stuff, like the mighty **Rust** language. I have a few projects and probably more now that you are reading this. I love Linux too, I'm looking forward switching completely to ✨*EndeavourOS*✨.
