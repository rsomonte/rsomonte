# Hi, welcome to my GitHub

I study cybersecurity and computer science, and I love technology.
I enjoy learning new stuff, like the **Rust** language. I have a few projects and probably more now that you are reading this. I love Linux too, and I run Fedora KDE on my laptop (after a turbulent passage through Endeavour OS).

Btw, I'm just learning😎👍
